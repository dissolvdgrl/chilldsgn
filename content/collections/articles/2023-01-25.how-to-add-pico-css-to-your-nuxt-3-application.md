Building a quick prototype should be easy, and, well, quick. I am currently exploring headless CMS options for a project at work and need to do some testing to see if a particular CMS solution will do the trick for us.

I want to build a barebones prototype using the Javascript framework I am most comfortable with, which is Nuxt. 

First, get a Nuxt 3 app up and running. If you're no sure how to do this, please check out [their documentation site](https://nuxt.com/docs).

I wanted to use [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/), because it's minimal and easy to get a good looking prototype up and running. I am used to TailwindCSS's way of doing things and that's just too much right now.

First, install Pico.css using npm
```
npm install @picocss/pico
```


Then, in your Nuxt project root, add an assets directory with an empty CSS file. I've added one in 
```
assets/css/app.css
```


Next, you have to add the following line in the CSS file:

```
@import url('@picocss/pico/css/pico.slim.css)
```


I used the slim build, because I want this prototype as lightweight as possible.

Finally, run your build script ```npm run dev``` (or whatever you're using and you should be able to start using Pico.css in your project.
